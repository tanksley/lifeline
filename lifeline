  <p>This idea came about when a girl I was keen on said to me 'I need a timetable and map to keep up with your life' So...in a totally normal way, I decided to build a site for it.</p>

<p> I lived in Yan'an for three months the summer of 2007.

    <p> In 2009 I took a trip to the Gobi dessert. Yeah! Nomads.</p>

    <p> I lived in Hailer from 2010-2011. This is where I saw snow and had a girlfriend. Awww...young love </p>

<p> I moved to Xiamen in 2011 after traveling to Thailand. Things got weird. I had 40$ and a two month visa. Things became bleak. </p>
  <img src='photos/hongkong.jpg' height=490px width=720px/>
  <p> On a visa run I became trapped in Hong Kong over New Years. Broke, down to my last pair of underwear, I stayed in the Sikh temple and made new friends. Fixed the blue dude's ipod.</p>

    <p> I left Hong Kong, went back to Xiamen and then got an email that said 'come to yemen?' I agreed. Feb of 2012. Things went south. People died. BUT I did get to see the Red Sea. Moses...wut...wut</p>

    <p> Evacuated May of 2012, sent back to America. I moved into my parents house and after about seven months I was gone again. Couldn't cut it. Moving home is hard.</p>
      <img src='photos/xiamen.jpg' height=490px width=720px/>
      <p> Ah, Xiamen...old friend. I was here from winter of 2013 to September 2013.

      <p> In 2013 I moved back to Atlanta, moved into my friend's basement and started video production. I got pretty pale. Windowless rooms.</p>
        <img src='photos/nashville.jpg' height=490px width=720px/>
      <p> April 2014 I made the move to Nashville. It's nice to be in a place with a good group of friends and to be in a stage in my life where I feel I'm doing something valuable.</p>
